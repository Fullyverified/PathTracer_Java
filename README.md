I'm trying to make an Ascii Pathtracer. Nothing that hasn't been done before :)
Global Illuminiation is here!

One bounce.

Five bonuces. Areas not directly visible to the light begin to fill in.

Current formula: sum from the last bounce to the first bounce :
objectbrigthness * cosine law / * 0.85

Done:
1. Create ray and sphere objects.
2. Give the ray a positon and a direction vector.
3. Normalise the direction vector.
4. Discard the sphere if the Ray has no intersection points.
5. If the ray will intersect, march the ray until it intersects.
6. Add an interface that runs intersectionCheck() for each object added to the scene.
7. End the ray if it finds an intersection
8. Store the intersection location as part of the ray object.
9. Create more than one ray, such that each ray is a pixel of the camera.
10. Print (render) the final output :)
11. Spawn a new ray at the intersection towards the direction of each lightsource to test for shadows
12. Create a lookup table for values of brightness and their corresponding character: . . , : ; * X # @
13. Change the order of operations so that the first bounce, second bounce, third bounce etc is calculated for a pixel, then move onto the next pixel.
    Instead of doing for the first bounce for each pixel, then moving onto the second bounce etc.
    This is to truly make each pixel an independent entity to enable multi-threading in the future.
14. Completely reorganised the render thread. Method now works for an arbitrary number of bounces.
15. Cubes!

TODO LIST OF THINGS TODO:
2. Add more shapes, such as cubes, flat planes, triangles, and hopefully shapes of arbitrary proportions.
3. Add colour
4. Try to make it run in real time and add controls, so it can be game-ified (?)
5. Re-write it in C++ (in order to learn C++)
6. Re-write it in Vulkan to make it run on the GPU (big maybe)
7. Multi-threading

Known Bugs:

Fixed Bugs:
*Fixed long-standing issue with normal calculation. Y direction was using the x position :(*
*Major flaw found in second bounce method... removed for now*
*Finally fixed a problem regarding new the random direction given to new rays not facing away from the center of the sphere. This seriously took me like a week to fix and Im not even sure why it wor̵̠͚̫̜̯̠͕̀̊̀̔̎͐̄̀̇̚k̵̡̮͖̇̇͆s̷͎̤̺͖̍̋ ̷͙̩̹̟̦́́͛͊̉̎̈́ñ̴̩̻͑̏̉ơ̵̳̖͉̠̙̩̤̙͒͐̄̃w̵͖̌ ̶̛̦̤̺͙͕̗͉̅͘͜i̸̮̙̺̱̲͗̃m̸̠͍̋̊̽̍̉͋ ̶̜̦̣͕͓̹̦̞͊̄̅̆͛̋ĝ̴̙͉̪͎̓́̆̆̔̽͆͝ò̴̢̖̭̯̤͖͖̦̥͙̏̒͐̌̚ĩ̵̛̜̭͔̘̤̊̃̍́́̚͠ņ̷̗̩̻̼̃̒g̷͚̲̤͉̠͒̆̂͐̃͗̃̉̕ ̴͉̔̊̈́̏̆̓͋̓ͅċ̴̢̨̛͇̣͇͕͉͉̪̑̀̌̕͝͝r̵̢̻͆́͐͊̊͘a̵̳͙̱͕̝͙̙̦̺͗̽͝z̵̬̥͕̫͕͔̤͌͆̎̇͌̃̀͝͝y̵̤̜̜̺̖̳̐͜ ̶̛̺̗̣̝̈́͆̆̍̈́̎͜͠͠h̶̦̖̮̭̣̖̼͚̑̌͜ͅë̴̟̘̯́̊͜͠l̷͚̫̒̽͆̍͠p̵͓̙͍̟̞̟͓̤̘͛͌̕̕͠
